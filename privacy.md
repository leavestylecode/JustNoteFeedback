**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy is designed to help you understand how we handle your data when you use JustNote:Capture Insights. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in our data practices.

This privacy policy applies to the JustNote:Capture Insights app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Leavestyle Code Studio (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

**Information Collection and Use**

The Application does not collect any personal information from users. All user data is stored securely in Apple's iCloud service, which is subject to Apple's privacy policy and terms of service. The Service Provider does not have access to your personal data stored in iCloud.

Your notes and other content are automatically synced to your iCloud account when you enable iCloud sync in the Application. This synchronization is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud service, and the Service Provider has no access to this data.

**User Rights**

You have complete control over your data:
- You can enable or disable iCloud sync at any time
- You can delete your data from iCloud through your Apple account settings
- You can export your data from the Application
- You can request a copy of your data by contacting us

**Third Party Access**

The Application does not transmit any data to external services. All data is stored exclusively in your iCloud account, which is managed by Apple.

**Data Retention Policy**

Since the Application does not collect or store any user data directly, there is no data retention policy. Your data is managed according to Apple's iCloud terms of service and your iCloud account settings.

**Children**

The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (leavestyle101@gmail.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

**Security**

The Service Provider is committed to protecting your privacy. Since the Application does not collect or store any user data directly, all data security is handled by Apple's iCloud service, which provides robust security measures to protect your data.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-04-24

**Your Consent**

By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.

**Legal Jurisdiction**

This Privacy Policy is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Service Provider operates. Any disputes relating to this policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction.

**Contact Us**

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at leavestyle101@gmail.com.
